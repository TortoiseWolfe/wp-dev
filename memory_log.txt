# CLAUDE MEMORY LOG - Last Session: 4/18/2025

## WORK IN PROGRESS
You were working on:
1. SSL certificate setup for the WordPress site
2. Modifying the nginx configuration (`nginx/conf/default.conf`)
3. Updating the SSL setup script (`scripts/ssl/ssl-setup.sh`)
4. Updating the readme.md with proper deployment instructions

## CURRENT TEST STATUS
- The ssl-setup.sh script has been fixed to correctly handle Docker permissions
- Implemented proper sudo handling for all docker-compose commands
- Differentiated between root and non-root contexts for all Docker commands
- Updated CLAUDE.md with better documentation of the fix
- Tested the fix by implementing proper if/else blocks for all Docker commands

## CHANGES MADE
- Modified nginx/conf/default.conf to properly handle SSL configuration
- Updated readme.md with comprehensive deployment instructions including SSL setup
- Enhanced scripts/ssl/ssl-setup.sh with better error handling and logging
- Fixed Docker permission errors in ssl-setup.sh by properly handling root context:
  - Added `if [ "$(id -u)" -eq 0 ]` checks before all docker commands
  - Using docker-compose directly when run as root 
  - Using sudo -E docker-compose when not run as root
- Updated CLAUDE.md with documentation about the Docker permission error fix
- Successfully implemented consistent permission handling for all Docker operations

## NEXT STEPS
1. Test the fixed ssl-setup.sh script by running: `sudo ./scripts/ssl/ssl-setup.sh`
2. Verify the script runs without permission errors (no "kill EPERM")
3. Check if certificates are correctly generated
4. Verify Nginx can use the certificates
5. Document the full SSL setup process in readme.md if successful
6. Consider splitting the production environment into a separate docker-compose.prod.yml file
7. Implement additional PHP security configurations
8. Add firewall configuration examples for production servers

## ERRORS ENCOUNTERED
- Docker permission error: "Error: kill EPERM" - This appeared when using sudo inside scripts that were already run with sudo
- Resolution: Modified ssl-setup.sh to use docker-compose directly when run as root, instead of sudo -E docker-compose
- Claude crash on 4/18/2025: "Error: kill EPERM at process.kill" - Lost work context
- Resolution: Maintaining this memory log and fixing the Docker permission issue in ssl-setup.sh

## IMPORTANT NOTES
- The ssl-setup.sh script has been fixed to prevent Docker permission errors
- The script must still be run with sudo: `sudo ./scripts/ssl/ssl-setup.sh`
- Inside the script, it now detects if it's running as root and adjusts Docker commands accordingly
- The nginx configuration has been updated with proper SSL settings
- The recommended deployment workflow now includes proper sequence for GitHub authentication
- All Docker commands check for root context before deciding whether to use sudo
## SESSION 4/19/2025

## CONTEXT RECOVERY
- Reviewed docs/CLAUDE.md and memory_log.txt to restore context from previous session

## NEXT STEPS (FROM PREVIOUS LOG)
1. Test the fixed ssl-setup.sh script by running: `sudo ./scripts/ssl/ssl-setup.sh`
2. Verify the script runs without permission errors (no "kill EPERM")
3. Check if certificates are correctly generated
4. Verify Nginx can use the certificates
5. Document the full SSL setup process in readme.md if successful
6. Consider splitting the production environment into a separate docker-compose.prod.yml file
7. Implement additional PHP security configurations
8. Add firewall configuration examples for production servers

## PLANNED ACTIONS FOR THIS SESSION
- Execute and validate the SSL setup script end-to-end
- Update readme.md with confirmed SSL setup instructions
- Proceed to refactor production compose file if SSL setup is successful

## CURRENT TASK
- Executing `sudo ./scripts/ssl/ssl-setup.sh` to validate SSL setup script and ensure no permission errors

## TASK UPDATE: SSL SETUP SCRIPT EXECUTION
- Ran wrapper command: `sudo bash -x scripts/ssl/ssl-setup.sh 2>&1 | tee ssl-setup-wrapper.log`
- Wrapper log saved to: ssl-setup-wrapper.log
- Script log saved to: /tmp/ssl-setup-20250419-010305.log
- Exit code: 0 (success)
- No Docker permission errors ("kill EPERM") encountered.
- Let's Encrypt issuance failed due to rate limits: "too many certificates (5) already issued..."
- Script fell back to self-signed certificate and updated Nginx config accordingly.
- Nginx restarted successfully; HTTPS access returned status 200.
- Next step: reviewed and updated README.md and ssl-setup.sh with staging support:
  - Defined STAGING_FLAG and BREAK_FLAG to request staging certs
  - Updated certbot invocation to include --staging and --break-my-certs in staging mode
  - Verified fallback to production self-signed cert when ride fails
  - Documented staging usage in README

## STAGING TEST
- Command: `STAGING=1 sudo -E bash -x scripts/ssl/ssl-setup.sh 2>&1 | tee staging3-wrapper.log`
- Wrapper log: staging3-wrapper.log
- Script log: /tmp/ssl-setup-20250419-012047.log
- Exit code: 0 (success)
- Used flags: --staging, --break-my-certs
- Successfully obtained staging certificate (marked TEST_CERT)
- Nginx restarted; HTTPS returned status 200

## NEXT STEPS
1. Wait for production rate limit reset (~2025-04-19 19:17 UTC) to request real certificates
2. Document automated cron job for production SSL issuance and renewal (added to README)
3. Consider adding a command-line flag (--staging) to ssl-setup.sh for convenience
4. Split production compose to docker-compose.prod.yml
5. Implement additional PHP security configurations
6. Add firewall configuration examples for production servers
