# ScriptHammer Music System: Implementation Considerations

This document explores practical considerations for implementing ScriptHammer's music system within our WordPress environment, focusing on feasible solutions with available technologies.

## Container Architecture Options

### Option 1: Dedicated Music Processing Container
- **Description**: Add a specialized container to the Docker Compose stack specifically for audio processing
- **Technologies**: 
  - [JUCE](https://juce.com/) framework for audio processing
  - [WebDAW](https://github.com/petersalomonsen/wasm-music) for in-browser music workstation
  - Node.js backend for API communication with WordPress
- **Pros**: Isolates CPU-intensive audio processing, dedicated resources
- **Cons**: Adds complexity to the Docker setup, potential communication overhead

### Option 2: WordPress Plugin with WebAssembly
- **Description**: Create a WordPress plugin that uses WebAssembly for audio processing directly in the browser
- **Technologies**:
  - Web Audio API
  - Emscripten-compiled audio libraries
  - Service Workers for offline processing
- **Pros**: Simpler architecture, no additional container needed
- **Cons**: Limited by browser capabilities, higher client-side resource usage

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
- **Description**: Basic audio functionality as WordPress plugin with optional processing offloaded to serverless functions
- **Technologies**:
  - WordPress plugin for user interface and basic features
  - AWS Lambda or similar for intensive audio processing
  - S3 for audio file storage
- **Pros**: Scalable, pay-per-use for intensive operations
- **Cons**: Requires cloud infrastructure, potential latency issues

## Collaboration Methods

### Real-time Collaboration
- **Websockets**: Enable real-time updates between band members
- **WebRTC**: For audio streaming during live jam sessions
- **Operational Transformation**: For conflict resolution when multiple members edit the same composition
- **Considerations**: 
  - Network latency will be a significant challenge for truly synchronous play
  - Consider a conductor-follower model where one member (Ivory) sets the tempo

### Asynchronous Collaboration
- **Version Control**: Git-like system for tracking composition changes
- **Track Isolation**: Allow members to work on isolated tracks that are later merged
- **Approval Workflow**: Band leader (Ivory) can approve or request changes
- **Considerations**:
  - Much more feasible than real-time collaboration
  - Enables high-quality output without network constraints

## Storage and Format Considerations

### Music Data Storage
1. **For Compositions**:
   - Store as structured data in WordPress custom post types
   - JSON representation of musical elements (notes, timing, parameters)
   - Version history using post revisions API

2. **For Audio Files**:
   - WordPress media library for final output
   - Consider external storage (S3) with WordPress integration for large files
   - Implement caching strategy for frequently accessed files

### File Formats
1. **Internal Formats**:
   - MIDI for note data
   - JSON for metadata and parameters
   - MusicXML for notation when needed

2. **Distribution Formats**:
   - MP3 (320kbps) for standard downloads
   - FLAC for high-quality downloads
   - HLS/DASH for adaptive streaming

## Monetization Implementation

### Digital Tip Jar
- **Implementation**: WooCommerce with variable pricing or Simple Pay plugin
- **Features**: 
  - Let fans choose amount
  - Special "thank you" message or content for tippers
  - Leaderboard of top supporters

### Content Selling Options
- **Digital Downloads**: WooCommerce Digital Downloads
- **Streaming Subscriptions**: Membership Pro or similar
- **Special Access**: Access control to live sessions or unreleased content

### Alternative Revenue Models
- **Virtual Merchandise**: Digital artwork, custom samples from band members
- **Commission System**: Fans can commission custom compositions
- **Licensing**: License tracks for other creators to use

## Live Streaming Options

### Self-hosted Streaming
- **Technologies**: 
  - OBS for capture
  - nginx-rtmp module for streaming server
  - Video.js for player
- **Pros**: Complete control, no platform restrictions
- **Cons**: Bandwidth costs, technical complexity

### Third-party Integration
- **Options**:
  - YouTube Live (embed in WordPress)
  - Twitch (embed in WordPress)
  - Crowdcast for interactive sessions
- **Pros**: Reliable infrastructure, existing audience
- **Cons**: Platform restrictions, less control, external branding

### Hybrid Approach
- Stream simultaneously to own site and third-party platforms
- Use rtmp-restreamer to broadcast to multiple destinations
- Embed primary stream in WordPress site

## WordPress Integration Points

### Content Management
- **Custom Post Types**:
  - Compositions (in-progress works)
  - Releases (completed works)
  - Performances (recordings of live sessions)
- **Taxonomies**:
  - Musical styles
  - Featured instruments
  - Moods/themes

### User Roles and Permissions
- **Band Member Role**: Custom role for ScriptHammer members
- **Collaborator Role**: For guest musicians
- **Listener Role**: For fans with premium access
- **Implementation**: Use Member Press or similar role management plugin
