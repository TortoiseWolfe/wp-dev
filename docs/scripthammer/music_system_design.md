# ScriptHammer Music System Design

## Overview
This document outlines design considerations for implementing ScriptHammer's music creation, recording, and distribution capabilities within our WordPress environment. This is an architectural proposal, not actual code implementation.

## Music Creation and Collaboration

### Container Architecture
1. **Dedicated Music Container**
   - A specialized Docker container for music generation and processing
   - Includes DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) components and audio processing libraries
   - Uses low-latency audio drivers optimized for real-time collaboration
   - Connects to WordPress via API for content management

2. **Audio Processing Tech Stack**
   - Base layer: JACK Audio Connection Kit for low-latency audio routing between components
   - Core engine: SuperCollider for algorithmic music generation
   - Sample management: Custom sample library with version control
   - Frontend interfaces: Web Audio API for browser-based interactions

### Music Formats and Storage

1. **Source Formats**
   - **MIDI**: For core compositional elements (notes, timing, velocities)
   - **Music XML**: For sheet music representation and notation
   - **Instrument Definition Files**: Custom formats defining each band member's sonic capabilities
   - **Algorithm Scripts**: Code that defines each band member's musical "personality"

2. **Output Formats**
   - High-quality WAV/FLAC for master recordings
   - MP3/OGG/AAC for streaming and downloads
   - Specialized "ScriptHammer Format" (SHF) that includes both the final audio and the generative algorithms

3. **Storage Solution**
   - Object storage (S3-compatible) for audio files
   - Git-based version control for compositions and algorithms
   - WordPress media library integration for public-facing content

## Collaboration Workflow

1. **Asynchronous Collaboration**
   - Each band member (user account) can contribute to compositions via a specialized interface
   - Version control system tracks all contributions with detailed history
   - Project branching allows for experimental variations
   - Merge functionality combines different musical ideas

2. **Real-time Jam Sessions**
   - WebRTC-based system for low-latency audio streaming between band members
   - Shared virtual studio environment showing all members' contributions in real-time
   - Session recording automatically captures both individual stems and mixed output
   - Chat/annotation system for communication during sessions

3. **Role-Based Permissions**
   - Ivory (band leader): Full composition and arrangement rights
   - Specialized roles for other band members (e.g., Crash can modify rhythm tracks, Chops can edit harmonic elements)
   - Guest collaborator mode for temporary access
   - Listener mode for fans who want to observe the creative process

## Distribution and Monetization

1. **Digital Distribution**
   - Integration with WordPress for content management
   - Custom post types for albums, tracks, and performances
   - Media player with advanced features (visualization, interactive elements)
   - Download options for various formats (MP3, FLAC, SHF)

2. **Streaming Capabilities**
   - Live performance streaming with WebRTC and HLS fallback
   - Scheduled broadcasts of jam sessions
   - Interactive elements where listeners can influence performances
   - Multi-bitrate streaming for different connection speeds

3. **Monetization Models**
   - **Digital Tip Jar**: WooCommerce integration for one-time donations
   - **Subscription Access**: Membership plugin for premium content
   - **Tokenized Ownership**: Potential blockchain integration for fans to "own" pieces of compositions
   - **Algorithmic Licensing**: Allow fans to license band members' algorithms for their own music

4. **Analytics and Feedback**
   - Detailed playback and engagement metrics
   - Heat mapping of user interactions with music
   - Feedback collection system integrated with composition workflow
   - A/B testing of musical variations to inform future compositions

## Technical Considerations

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Audio processing offloaded to dedicated container
   - Caching strategy for rendered audio
   - Progressive loading for long-form content
   - WebAssembly for CPU-intensive audio algorithms in browser

2. **Security**
   - DRM considerations for premium content
   - Watermarking of audio files
   - Access control for unreleased material
   - Copyright management system

3. **Scalability**
   - Horizontal scaling for handling multiple simultaneous jam sessions
   - CDN integration for audio file delivery
   - Database sharding for high-volume listener interactions
   - Queue-based processing for audio rendering jobs

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Basic WordPress integration with custom post types for music content
- Simple audio player embedded in posts
- Upload capability for pre-rendered tracks
- Basic tip jar functionality

### Phase 2: Enhanced Collaboration
- Dedicated music container with basic DAW functionality
- Version control for compositions
- Basic asynchronous collaboration features
- Improved media player with visualization

### Phase 3: Live Capabilities
- Real-time jam session infrastructure
- Live streaming capabilities
- Interactive audience features
- Enhanced monetization options

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- Algorithmic music generation capabilities
- SHF format implementation
- Tokenized ownership options
- Mobile app integration

## Plugin Requirements

1. **Core Music System**
   - Custom plugin for managing band members, compositions, and recordings
   - Integration with BuddyPress for social aspects
   - REST API endpoints for container communication

2. **Third-party Integrations**
   - WooCommerce for transactions
   - BuddyPress for community features
   - Media management plugins
   - Caching solutions

## Infrastructure Needs

1. **Storage**
   - High-performance block storage for active compositions
   - Object storage for finished recordings
   - CDN for content delivery

2. **Compute**
   - Dedicated instances for audio processing
   - Auto-scaling for handling traffic spikes during live events
   - GPU acceleration for complex algorithmic compositions

3. **Networking**
   - Low-latency options for real-time collaboration
   - WebRTC infrastructure for live streaming
   - Bandwidth considerations for high-quality audio delivery

## Open Questions for Discussion

1. How should we handle intellectual property rights for algorithmic compositions?
2. What's the best approach for ensuring consistent audio quality across different listening environments?
3. Should we consider blockchain technologies for provenance tracking of compositions?
4. How can we balance computational requirements with accessibility for users on lower-end devices?
5. What's the optimal pricing model for different types of content (compositions, live performances, algorithm access)?
